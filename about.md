## #whoami
I work as a Red Teamer and I have decided to create this blog to write about some technical infosec stuff. Sometimes personal anecdotes, always related to the infosec world somehow.
I love to learn, do CTFs, programming (Java, Python, Bash...). 
I like helping people, so feel free to reach me out.
